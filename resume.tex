\section{Works}

\subsection{Websites}
I have built some production ready websites, static as well as dynamic.\\
\\
Here's my personal website built by myself.
It's build using hugo, a static site generator:-\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	URL: & \url{https://vikas.rocks} \\
	Source: & \url{https://github.com/csstudent41/hugo-site} \\
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
I worked on organizing a tech fest event in my college.
It was titled as 'BITS'.
I and my friend built the landing page for BITS which was the gateway for user registrations :\\
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	URL: & \url{https://bits24.onrender.com}\\
	Source: & \url{https://github.com/vtc-tech/vtc-tech.github.io}\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Linux}
I am well versed in usage and management of the Linux Operating System.
I am using it as my daily driver for over a half a decade now.
You can find my Linux Configurations and scripts on GitHub:-\\

\subsection{Scraping}
I scraped my college's exam results which are rolled out in PDF format and
turned it into friendly HTML tables showing final scores of each student in a single list.
It's available on my website:-\\
\tab \url{https://csstudent41.github.io/results}\\
The raw PDF files are uploaded to Google Drive :-\\
\tab \url{https://tinyurl.com/vartakdrive}\\
The scripts used to scrape the PDF documents and build the HTML DOM are in my vartak-bin repository.
It also contains some other stuff that I use to manage my college files generally.
The files that we care about are named as vartak-results-*\\
